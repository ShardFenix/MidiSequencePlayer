# MidiSequencePlayer

A midi player that can play arbitrary or defined sequences of integers. Play around with different sequences and see if you can find any that sound interesting.

## Usage

To define your own sequence, create a class implementing Function. The implementation should return the nth member of the sequence. I have included the sequence of Primes, and the sequence of Twin Prime Gaps as examples.
